SecurityCamera
========

###Overview

I am developing an security camera app that allows users to recycle old android phones in a very cool way.
SecurityCamera will have two states, a server state and a client state. Each state requires it's own device. 
The user will place the server device somewere with power and within wifi (or cell) range. 
The client device will be the user's main mobile device.

The application runs on an android device and uploads (or streams) a visual (photo or video) feed to the 
client device when requested by the client. 

###Motivation: 

I live on a one way stree with very limited parking. I want to be able to see if there is a parking spot
near my house before I turn onto the one-way street. I will install SecurityCamera on an old android device
and position it so that the street is in the camera's field of view. 

###Next Steps: 

Lots of things....
- Dropbox or AWS integration (image upload)
- ...many more

###Blocks:
